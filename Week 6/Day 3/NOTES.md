Difference between Union and Join?
- Union: Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set that includes all the rows that belong to all queries in the union.
- Join: Combines columns from one or more tables in a relational database.

Row ma and column ma
Row add garne hunxa Union ma,
Column add garne hunxa Join ma


SubQuery vs Join usage:
SubQuery fails when the returned results is extremely large.
Join has advantage as result is already in the single table.
